# Image-Segmentation-with-PyTorch-
Objectives:
1. Understand the Segmentation Dataset and apply segmentation augmentation to augment images as well as its masks. 
2. Use albumentation library for image-mask augmentation.
3. Plot Image-Mask pair for visualization.
4. Load a pretrained state of the art convolutional neural network for segmentation problem(for e.g, Unet) using segmentation model pytorch library
This implementation is a part of the course "Deep Learning with PyTorch : Image Segmentation" from Coursera
