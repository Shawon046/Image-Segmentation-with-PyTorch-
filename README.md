# Image-Segmentation-with-PyTorch-
Understand the Segmentation Dataset and apply segmentation augmentation to augment images as well as its masks. 
Use albumentation library for image-mask augmentation.
Plot Image-Mask pair for visualization.
Load a pretrained state of the art convolutional neural network for segmentation problem(for e.g, Unet) using segmentation model pytorch library
